# Sparkle Pony!

In honor of Pride Month 2017, I'm leveraging the power of the Amazon Alexa platform to help the people of the world answer the most pressing existential question of our time: _What should my drag superstar name be?_ 

No, seriously! That's the magic of Sparkle Pony. Well, declaring drag names and the firing off the occasional clap-back response. If I remember calculating combinatorics correctly, there's about 1,600 drag names out there just waiting to meet you.

**What kinds of things can you ask Sparkle Pony you inquire? How's this:**
* Alexa, ask Sparkle Pony if I'm pretty. _(I can attest that Sparkle Pony thinks you are.)_
* Alexa, ask Sparkle Pony to make me a comedy drag name. _(Pretty direct, eh?)_
* Alexa, ask Sparkle Pony if I should shantay. _(I don't know, should you?)_

**Feel the need for this level of magic in your life? Make it so:**
1. Have an Amazon Echo device (goes without say, but for completeness sake, I'm saying it.)
2. Fire up the Alexa app. From the Menu, select Skills.
3. Use the search bar find Sparkle Pony. (You could also find it by browsing Novelty & Humor).
4. When you find it, select Enable Skill.
5. Marvel in your new-found eleganza! 

_**Note**: No ponies (ponys?) were harmed in the creation of Sparkle Pony. Promise. However, a few cocktails may have been consumed during its development. Have more suggestions for name inputs? Send me a pull request!_
